<h1>About us</h1>
<h6>THE COMPANY</h6>
<p>Bless Africa Tours and Safaris specialises in providing Mountain Trekking, Safari and Beach Holidays in Tanzania. Set in the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro, Bless Africa Tours and Safaris is the fastest growing local tour operator based in Moshi,
<p>Tanzania has been blessed with a rich history and cultural heritage, idyllic beaches, amazing wildlife, and the roof-top of Africa – Mount Kilimanjaro. All of this is complemented by the warm hospitality of the charming Tanzanian people making a visit to Tanzania a holiday experience that will always be remembered.
<p>Bless Africa Tours and Safaris is registered under the Tanzania Company Act, 2002. The company is owned by Tanzanians who, after years of working for other established companies in the industry as guides, sought out a more independent approach in order to develop their own professional opportunities and those of fellow working partners. 
<p>Bless Africa Tours and Safaris aims to offer unique holiday packages which are both inspiring to travellers, while at the same time bringing benefits to the local people, wildlife and environment. 
<p>Holidays with Bless Africa Tours and Safaris can be tailor-made and the Team are able to offer trips covering the whole of Tanzania. The company specialises in Trekking experiences on Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru, Safaris to Tanzania’s outstanding National Parks including Taringire, Serengeti, Ngorongoro Crater, Lake Manyara and Arusha, and  Beach Holidays to the beautiful Tanzanian coastal resorts of Pangani, Bagamoyo and the island of Zanzibar. 
<p>If our clients would like to experience even more of Africa, , or to explore other activities such as cycling, the Kilimanjaro Marathon, the Team can offer a free consultation.</p>
